# covid-youtube-api
My code from the COVID YouTube Analytics project at Mac-Theobio. This is a utilization of the YouTube API v3 to get COVID-related data from YouTube. To get up-to-date videos (but not the original data, as this has changed since August 2020), run initial_downloader.py. An extremely basic analysis of the new data as of December 7, 2021 is presented in `basic_analysis.ipynb.`

Each time range includes the first date (e.x. October 9) at 12:00:01 AM, and the second date (e.x. October 16) at 12:00:00 AM.

We are currently in the process of publishing a manuscript resulting from this project. The main content analysis was done manually and is not in this repository (this repository should only be relied upon for downloader code).
